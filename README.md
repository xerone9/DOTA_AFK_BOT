 If you are AFK it will move your player

### _Use this app at your own risk. I am not responsible if you get ban for that_


## How To Use:
Run the app and set afk time in seconds For DOTA I guess its 300

### Select Options

#### 1- Move Mouse

It will move mouse after given time period

#### 2- Cast Spell

It will press Q W E after given time period so any spell that requires no target will be casted

#### 3- Send Message

It will ask to enter message and after given period of time. The message will be typed and send to your allies

## Note:
It will only check mouse movements to assess that you are AFK or not. so if you are continously typing but not moving mouse for given time the app will detect you as AFK. Will fix it later onwards
